    <b>Dance</b> is a performing art <i>form consisting of sequences of movement</i>, either improvised or <u>purposefully selected.</u> This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.[4]
    <strike>An important distinction</strike> is to be drawn <small>between</small> the <big>contexts of</big> theatrical and participatory dance,[5] although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical.

         these <cite>two categories</cite> are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial,

          Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. It often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed and performed in a theatre setting but it is not a requirement. Examples are western ballet and modern dance, Classical Indian dance such as Bharatanatyam and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas such as dragon dance. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.

          <dfn>dance, on the other hand</dfn> , whether it be a folk dance, <kbd>a social dance</kbd>, 
          <pre>a group dance such as a line, 
            circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance such as is 
            common in Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily 
            for a common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, </pre>
            or building flexibility of participants rather than to serve any
           benefit to onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a corps de ballet, a social partner dance and a pas de deux, differ profoundly. Even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.
